			<p>Think all men are created equal? <strong>Then how do you explain Brock Lesnar?</strong></p>
			<p>Possessing the type of staggering strength and scary intensity usually only seen in Superman villains, the 6-foot-3, 266-pound freak of nature from Minneapolis, Minn., has forced his way to the top of every major combat sport. He won the NCAA Division I collegiate wrestling championship as a senior at the University of Minnesota, the WWE Championship within six months of his debut and the UFC Heavyweight Title in his fourth professional MMA fight. He’s also the 1 in 21-1. Plain and simple, the man was built to destroy.</p>
